# Arduino Tutorials
Purpose: To experiment with different electrical components, learn to use and code in Arduino IDE, understand the interactions between electrical components to build mini projects

In progress: Updating some old tutorials by applying state machines to clean up the code

### Tutorial 1
Turning on and off an LED

### Tutorial 3
Learning to work with a breadboard

### Tutorial 4
4.1 Learning to use Arduino variables

4.2 Using variabled to code morse code blinking lights

4.3 Using variables to change length of blinking lights

### Tutorial 6
6.1 Learning binary numbers and using 4 LEDs to count from 0 to 15

6.2 Counting 0 to 31 using 5 LEDs
